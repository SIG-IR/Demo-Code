This is the demo code for frontend + d3.

To run the index.html, simply double click on the html file.
To run the d3 code, you need to run it under a server in order for the browser to properly render the SVG. To do this, go to your terminal and type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" followed by the file that you want to open. Then navigate to your browser and go to "localhost:8000/d3.html"
